    <h3>History of Yoga</h3>
    <p>
      Yoga began as an ancient practice that originated in India circa 3000 B.C. Stone-carved figures of yoga postures can be found in the Indus Valley depicting the original poses and practices. Yoga was developed as a way to achieve harmony between the heart and soul on the path to divine enlightenment. Along the way, it was discovered that yoga has a practical benefit of curing many diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure, and alleviating physical injuries and chronic pains. Yoga has taken off in the West as an answer to helping ailments. And as yoga has become increasingly popular outside of India and in so many widely varying cultures, so has the practice cleaved into many different schools of teachings and avenues.

    <h3>Benefits of Yoga</h3>
    <p>Yoga increases body awareness, relieves stress, reduces muscle tension, strain, and inflammation, sharpens attention and concentration, and calms and centers the nervous system.
      Yogaâ€™s positive benefits on mental health have made it an important practice tool of psychotherapy (<a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/11/yoga">American Psychological Association</a>). It has been shown to enhance social well being through a sense of belonging to others, and improve the symptoms of depression, attention deficit and hyperactivity, and sleep disorders. Also, yoga can improve symptoms of schizophrenia when it is done alongside drug therapy.</p>
